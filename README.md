# Number-Guessing-Game(Python)
## 📌Project Description
The Number Guessing Game is a simple python console based game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.
The game includes three difficulty levels that control the guessing range and number of chances.

This project demonstrates basic python concepts such as loops, conditionals, user input handling and random number generation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Built-in module: random

## ⚙️ How the Game works

1. The user selects a difficulty level.
2. Based on the choice, the program sets:
   - A number range
